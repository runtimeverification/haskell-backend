<a name="BMC"></a>*BMC*

1. (noun, acronym)
   Bounded model checking. Execute the program on all paths for a given number of steps (a.k.a. bound), attempting to identify given properties (bugs, unexpected behaviours, and so on) in the execution graph.

<a name="constructor-like"></a>*constructor-like*

1. (adjective)
   A pattern is *constructor-like* if logical equality is syntactic equality.  A
   pattern is constructor-like if it is logically equal (in the `\equals` sense)
   to another constructor-like pattern if and only if the patterns are
   syntactically equal. The constructor-like patterns of a sort comprise a
   normal form of elements in that sort.
1. (adjective)
   A symbol is *constructor-like* if it may form the head of a constructor-like
   application pattern (in the sense defined above). Roughly, this means the
   symbol has injectivity and no-confusion axioms.


<a name="function"></a>*function*

1. (noun)
   An application symbol that, when applied to [function-like](#functionlike)
   patterns, produces function-like patterns.
1. (noun/adjective)
   A [function-like](#functionlike) pattern.

<a name="functionlike"></a>*function-like*

1. (adjective)
   A function-like pattern can have at most one value, i.e. it satisfies
   `(∃x . x=φ) ∨ ¬⌈φ⌉`.

<a name="functional"></a>*functional*

1. (adjective)
   A functional pattern has exactly one value, i.e. it satisfies `(∃x . x=φ)`.

<a name="pattern"></a>*pattern*

1. (noun)
   A syntactic element constructed according to the rules described in the
   [kore-syntax document](http://github.com/kframework/kore/blob/master/docs/kore-syntax.md#patterns).
2. (noun)
   The internal representation of such a syntactic element. It may have
   constructs which cannot be represented directly into syntactic elements
   (e.g. map domain values), but it is expected that it is possible to create
   an equivalent syntactic representation.

<a name="predicate"></a>*predicate*

1. (noun)
   A [pattern](#pattern) that can be evaluate only to top and bottom.
   Application patterns that can only evaluate to top and bottom are hard to
   identify, so some of the code that identifies predicates fails on these.
   Whenever a [substitution](#substitution) can be extracted efficiently,
   the "predicate" term may refer to the non-substitution part of the predicate.

<a name="SBC"></a>*SBC*

1. (noun, acronym)
   Semantics-based compilation. Compilation that uses the semantics of the
   language to analyze the behaviour of the program (e.g. through symbolic
   execution), and uses what it learned to improve the compilation result.

<a name="sort-injection"></a>*sort injection*

1. (noun)
   A [symbol](#symbol) with the `sortInjection` attribute. The sort injection
   symbol is used to represent the K sub-sort relation in Kore: K sorts contain
   symbols and sorts (their sub-sorts), but Kore sorts contain only symbols; the
   sort injection symbol wraps patterns of a sub-sort so they can be included
   (_injected_) into the super-sort. Two important properties follow from this
   definition: first, that sort injection symbols are injective; second, that
   the sort injection symbol from a particular sub-sort is distinct (in the
   no-confusion-different-constructors sense) from the super-sort's
   constructors.
1. (noun)
   A [sort injection](#sort-injection) is a [pattern](#pattern) of the form,
   ```
   inj{Sub{}, Super{}}(φ:Sub{})
   ```
   where `inj{Sub{}, Super{}}` is a sort injection symbol (described
   above). Where the K sort `Super` contains `Sub`, the pattern `φ` with
   least-sort `Sub` can appear anywhere that a term of sort `Super` is
   required. In Kore, this is represented with the injection above because all
   sorts are regarded as distinct.

<a name="substitution"></a>*substitution*

1. (noun)
   A [predicate](#predicate) of the form `x1=φ1 ∧ x2=φ2 ∧ ... ∧ xn=φn` where
   `xi` are variables and `φi` are patterns.

<a name="termpattern"></a>*term pattern*

1. (noun)
   A [pattern](#pattern) of a specific type. A term pattern is usually
   constructed with variables and function application patterns, but,
   in many cases, it is used for any pattern with the expectation that it
   will be reduced, as much as reasonably possible,
   to a variable-application from.
