###### Review checklist

The author performs the actions on the checklist. The reviewer evaluates the work and checks the boxes as they are completed.

-   [ ] **Summary.** Write a summary of the changes. Explain what you did to fix the issue, and why you did it. Present the changes in a logical order. Instead of writing a summary in the pull request, you may push a clean Git history.
-   [ ] **Documentation.** Write documentation for new functions. Update documentation for functions that changed, or complete documentation where it is missing.
-   [ ] **Tests.** Write unit tests for every change. Write the unit tests that were missing before the changes. Include any examples from the reported issue as integration tests.
-   [ ] **Clean up.** The changes are already clean. Clean up anything near the changes that you noticed while working. This does not mean only spatially near the changes, but logically near: any code that interacts with the changes!
