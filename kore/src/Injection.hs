{- | The canonical injection or inclusion of @from â†ª into@.

We can think of @into@ being a sum type with @from@ the type of one of its
constructors, although it need not be implemented this way.

It is illustrative to consider the instance for 'Maybe':

@
instance Injection (Maybe a) a where
    inject  = Just
    retract = id
@

Left identity:

@
retract (inject x) = Just x
@

Note: left identity implies that @inject@ is indeed injective.

Invertibility, over the range of @retract@:

@
retract x = Just a => x = inject a
@

Note: invertibility is actually implied by the left identity property, provided
@inject@ and @retract@ are total functions.

from any type.
