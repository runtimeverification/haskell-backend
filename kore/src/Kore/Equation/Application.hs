{- | Log when an 'Equation' is actually applied.

@debugApplyEquation@ is different from 'debugAttemptEquationResult', which
only indicates if an equation is applicable, that is: if it could apply. If
multiple equations are applicable in the same place, the caller will determine
which is actually applied. Therefore, the /caller/ should use this log entry
after 'attemptEquation'.
