{- | Produce the final configurations of an applied rule.

The rule's 'ensures' clause is applied to the conditions and normalized. The
substitution is applied to the right-hand side of the rule to produce the final
configurations.

Because the rule is known to apply, @finalizeAppliedRule@ always returns exactly
one branch.
