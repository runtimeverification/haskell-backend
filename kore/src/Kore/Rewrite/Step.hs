{- | Attempt to unify a rule with the initial configuration.

The rule variables are renamed to avoid collision with the configuration. The
rule's 'RulePattern.requires' clause is combined with the unification
solution. The combined condition is simplified and checked for
satisfiability.

If any of these steps produces an error, then @unifyRule@ returns that error.

@unifyRule@ returns the renamed rule wrapped with the combined conditions on
unification. The substitution is not applied to the renamed rule.
