Unification algorithm based on "Competing for the AC-Unification Race"
(https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00881905) and "Combining Unification Algorithms"
(https://doi.org/10.1006/jsco.1993.1066) by Alexandre Boudet. We have taken
some adjustments for ACU unification from the Maude codebase as well.
(https://github.com/SRI-CSL/Maude/blob/master/src/ACU_Theory/ACU_UnificationSubproblem2.cc)

The algorithm for ACU unification has been adapted specifically for K, in
particular based on the assumption that all ACU unification problems will have
no uninterpreted functions and each map or set element will consist of a single
free constructor representing a single element operating over a sort containing
a single ACU constructor, concatenation.

    -- this fold is rather tricky. We might have a unification problem that
    -- looks something like this:
    --
    -- (free)
    -- ------
    -- Elem1 = K1 |-> V1
    -- Elem2 = K2 |-> V2
    --
    -- (ac equation)
    -- -------------
    -- Elem1 M1 = Elem2 M2
    --
    -- (ac solution)
    -- ----------
    -- Elem1 = V1
    -- M1 = V2
    -- Elem2 = V1
    -- M2 = V2
    --
    -- Our goal is to remove all bindings from the ac solution which bind
    -- variables to variables. However, there are multiple ways of doing this.
    -- We could substitute Elem1 and M1, or we could substitute Elem1 and M2,
    -- etc. From a unification perspective, it doesn't really matter which ones
    -- we replace as we will end up with the same equalities in the end no
    -- matter what. However, it turns out we are actually constrained as to
    -- which ones we substitute, since it affects the /orientation/ of the
    -- equalities. The substitution normalization algorithm requires that
    -- variables which compare less-than be on the LHS and variables which
    -- compare greater-than be on the RHS. This is important if, as here,
    -- these equalities, once simplified, end up in the final solution.
    --
    -- Thus, we must use `foldlWithKey`, which processes elements from the
    -- greatest to the least, not `foldrWithKey`, which processes elements from
    -- the least to the greatest. That's because the elements we process first
    -- get removed from the substitution, while the elements we process last
    -- merely have their variables substituted on the rhs. By processing from
    -- greatest to least, we guarantee that the least elements in the
    -- substitution are the ones that remain at the end, which ought to
    -- preserve the invariant.
