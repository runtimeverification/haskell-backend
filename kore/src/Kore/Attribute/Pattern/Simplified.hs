{- | A pattern is 'Simplified' if it has run through the simplifier.

The simplifier runs until we do not know how to simplify a pattern any more. A
pattern 'isSimplified' if re-applying the simplifier would return the same
pattern.

Most patterns are assumed un-simplified until marked otherwise, so the
simplified status is reset by any substitution under the pattern.

{- | Computes the 'Simplified' attribute for a pattern given its default
attribute (usually a merge of the pattern's subterm simplification attributes)
and the desired one.

As an example, let us assume that the default attribute is
@Simplified (Partly, Condition c)@ and that we would want the attribute to be
@Simplified (Fully, Any)@.

Then let us notice that the term needs the condition @c@ (most likely because
one of its subterms is simplified only with it as a side condition), and that
the term and its subterms went through the simplifier (the 'Partly' tag), so
it's valid to mark it as fully simplified. The result will be
"Simplified (Fully, Condition c)".
