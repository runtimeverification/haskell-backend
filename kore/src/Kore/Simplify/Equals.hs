{-|'simplify' simplifies an 'Equals' pattern made of 'OrPattern's.

This uses the following simplifications
(t = term, s = substitution, p = predicate):

* Equals(a, a) = true
* Equals(phi, psi1 or psi2 or ... or psin), when phi is functional
    = or
        ( not ceil (phi) and not ceil(psi1) and ... and not ceil (psin)
        , and
            ( ceil(phi)
            , ceil(psi1) or ceil(psi2) or  ... or ceil(psin)
            , ceil(psi1) implies phi == psi1)
            , ceil(psi2) implies phi == psi2)
            ...
            , ceil(psin) implies phi == psin)
            )
        )
* Equals(t1 and t2) = ceil(t1 and t2) or (not ceil(t1) and not ceil(t2))
    if t1 and t2 are functions.
* Equals(t1 and p1 and s1, t2 and p2 and s2) =
    Or(
        And(
            Equals(t1, t2)
            And(ceil(t1) and p1 and s1, ceil(t2) and p2 and s2))
        And(not(ceil(t1) and p1 and s1), not(ceil(t2) and p2 and s2))
    )
    + If t1 and t2 can't be bottom, then this becomes
      Equals(t1 and p1 and s1, t2 and p2 and s2) =
        Or(
            And(
                Equals(t1, t2)
                And(p1 and s1, p2 and s2))
            And(not(p1 and s1), not(p2 and s2))
        )
    + If the two terms are constructors, then this becomes
      Equals(
        constr1(t1, t2, ...) and p1 and s1,
        constr2(t1', t2', ...) and p2 and s2)
        = Or(
            and(
                (p1 and s2) iff (p2 and s2),
                constr1 == constr2,
                ceil(constr1(t1, t2, ...), constr2(t1', t2', ...))
                Equals(t1, t1'), Equals(t2, t2'), ...
                )
            and(
                not(ceil(constr1(t1, t2, ...)) and p1 and s1),
                not(ceil(constr2(t1', t2', ...)), p2 and s2)
                )
        )
      Note that when expanding Equals(t1, t1') recursively we don't need to
      put the ceil conditions again, since we already asserted that.
      Also note that ceil(constr(...)) is simplifiable.
    + If the first term is a variable and the second is functional,
      then we get a substitution:
        Or(
            And(
                [t1 = t2]
                And(p1 and s1, p2 and s2))
            And(not(p1 and s1), not(p2 and s2))
        )
    + If the terms are Top, this becomes
      Equals(p1 and s1, p2 and s2) = Iff(p1 and s1, p2 and s2)
    + If the predicate and substitution are Top, then the result is any of
      Equals(t1, t2)
      Or(
          Equals(t1, t2)
          And(not(ceil(t1) and p1 and s1), not(ceil(t2) and p2 and s2))
      )

Normalization of the compared terms is not implemented yet, so
Equals(a and b, b and a) will not be evaluated to Top.

{- TODO (virgil): Preserve pattern sorts under simplification.

One way to preserve the required sort annotations is to make 'simplifyEvaluated'
take an argument of type

> CofreeF (Equals Sort) (Attribute.Pattern variable) (OrPattern variable)

instead of two 'OrPattern' arguments. The type of 'makeEvaluate' may
be changed analogously. The 'Attribute.Pattern' annotation will eventually cache
information besides the pattern sort, which will make it even more useful to
carry around.
