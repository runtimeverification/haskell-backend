{- |'simplify' simplifies an 'Exists' pattern with an 'OrPattern'
child.

The simplification of exists x . (pat and pred and subst) is equivalent to:

* If the subst contains an assignment y=x, then reverse that and continue with
  the next step.
* If the subst contains an assignment for x, then substitute that in pat and
  pred, reevaluate them and return
  (reevaluated-pat and reevaluated-pred and subst-without-x).
* Otherwise, if x occurs free in pred, but not in the term or the subst,
  and pred has the form phi=psi, then we try to match phi and psi. If the
  match result has the form `x=alpha`, then we return `top`.
  ( exists x . f(x)=f(alpha) is equivalent to
    exists x . (x=alpha) or (not(x==alpha) and f(x)=f(alpha)), which becomes
    (exists x . (x=alpha))
      or (exists x . (not(x==alpha) and f(x)=f(alpha)).
    But exists x . (x=alpha) == top, so the original term is top.
  )
* Let patX = pat if x occurs free in pat, top otherwise
      pat' = pat if x does not occur free in pat, top otherwise
  Let predX, pred' be defined in a similar way.
  Let substX = those substitutions in which x occurs free,
      subst' = the other substitutions
  + If patX is not top, then return
    (exists x . patX and predX and substX) and pred' and subst'
  + otherwise, return
    (pat' and (pred' and (exists x . predX and substX)) and subst')

{- TODO (virgil): Preserve pattern sorts under simplification.

One way to preserve the required sort annotations is to make 'simplifyEvaluated'
take an argument of type

> CofreeF (Exists Sort) (Attribute.Pattern variable) (OrPattern variable)

instead of a 'variable' and an 'OrPattern' argument. The type of
'makeEvaluate' may be changed analogously. The 'Attribute.Pattern' annotation
will eventually cache information besides the pattern sort, which will make it
even more useful to carry around.
