{- |'simplify' simplifies an 'Application' of 'OrPattern'.

To do that, it first distributes the terms, making it an Or of Application
patterns, each Application having 'Pattern's as children,
then it simplifies each of those.

Simplifying an Application of Pattern means merging the children
predicates ans substitutions, applying functions on the Application(terms),
then merging everything into an Pattern.
