-- TODO: Move Forall up in the other simplifiers or something similar. Note

-- immediately after evaluating the children.

{- |'simplify' simplifies an 'Forall' pattern with an 'OrPattern'
child.

Right now this has special cases for (top and bottom children),
(top and bottom term) and (top and bottom predicate-substitution).

Note that while forall x . phi(x) and [x=alpha] can be simplified
(it's bottom if x's sort is multivalued and alpha is not the 'x' pattern or
the identity function applied to the pattern x, or phi(alpha) otherwise),
we only expect forall usage for symbolic variables, so we won't attempt to
simplify it this way.

{- TODO (virgil): Preserve pattern sorts under simplification.

One way to preserve the required sort annotations is to make 'simplifyEvaluated'
take an argument of type

> CofreeF (Forall Sort) (Attribute.Pattern variable) (OrPattern variable)

instead of a 'variable' and an 'OrPattern' argument. The type of
'makeEvaluate' may be changed analogously. The 'Attribute.Pattern' annotation
will eventually cache information besides the pattern sort, which will make it
even more useful to carry around.
