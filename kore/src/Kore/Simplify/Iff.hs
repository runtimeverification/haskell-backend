{- |'simplify' simplifies an 'Iff' pattern with 'OrPattern'
children.

Right now this has special cases only for top and bottom children
and for children with top terms.

simplify ::
    SideCondition RewritingVariableName ->
    Iff Sort (OrPattern RewritingVariableName) ->
    Simplifier (OrPattern RewritingVariableName)
simplify sideCondition Iff{iffFirst = first, iffSecond = second, iffSort = sort} =
    simplifyEvaluated sort sideCondition first second

{- | evaluates an 'Iff' given its two 'OrPattern' children.

See 'simplify' for detailed documentation.

{- TODO (virgil): Preserve pattern sorts under simplification.

One way to preserve the required sort annotations is to make 'simplifyEvaluated'
take an argument of type

> CofreeF (Iff Sort) (Attribute.Pattern variable) (OrPattern variable)

instead of two 'OrPattern' arguments. The type of 'makeEvaluate' may
be changed analogously. The 'Attribute.Pattern' annotation will eventually cache
information besides the pattern sort, which will make it even more useful to
carry around.
