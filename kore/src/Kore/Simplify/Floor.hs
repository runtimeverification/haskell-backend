{- | 'simplify' simplifies a 'Floor' of 'OrPattern'.

We also take into account that
* floor(top) = top
* floor(bottom) = bottom
* floor leaves predicates and substitutions unchanged
* floor transforms terms into predicates

However, we don't take into account things like
floor(a and b) = floor(a) and floor(b).

{- TODO (virgil): Preserve pattern sorts under simplification.

One way to preserve the required sort annotations is to make 'simplifyEvaluated'
take an argument of type

> CofreeF (Floor Sort) (Attribute.Pattern variable) (OrPattern variable)

instead of an 'OrPattern' argument. The type of 'makeEvaluateFloor'
may be changed analogously. The 'Attribute.Pattern' annotation will eventually
cache information besides the pattern sort, which will make it even more useful
to carry around.
