 Tests whether the pair of terms can be coerced to have the same constructors
 at the top, and, if so, returns the thus obtained new pair.

 See <https://github.com/kframework/kore/blob/master/docs/2019-08-27-Unification-modulo-overloaded-constructors.md>

 If the overloading rules are not applicable, it would return @Nothing@.
 However, if it detects an unification failure, it would return a reason
 for the failure which can be used as an explanation for it.

 Note: this algorithm is used for both matching and unification; that is why
 the first and second terms in a pair are not interchangeable.
