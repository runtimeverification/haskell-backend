Compact regions written to handles this way are subject to some
restrictions:

 * Our binary representation contains direct pointers to the info
   tables of objects in the region.  This means that the info tables
   of the receiving process must be laid out in exactly the same
   way as from the original process; in practice, this means using
   static linking, using the exact same binary and turning off ASLR.  This
   API only does a very basic check and will probably segfault if you
   get it wrong.  DO NOT run this on untrusted input.

 * You must read out the value at the correct type.  We will
   check this for you and raise an error if the types do not match
   (this is what the 'Typeable' constraint is for).
