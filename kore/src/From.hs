{- | Convert type @from@ into @to@.

Valid instances are /total/. @from@ should be a homomorphism

the implementer.

Usage with @TypeApplications@:

@
let b = let a = _ in from @A @B a
@

Usage with both types inferred:

@
let b :: B = let a :: A = _ in from a

Usage with only @to@ inferred:

@
let b :: B = let a = _ in from @A a

Usage with only @from@ inferred:

let b = let a :: A = _ in from @_ @B a
