The two results are essentially the same, the following differences exist:

* Certain expressions have been replaced by domain values, based on the input constraints, e.g. `lookup(VarS:SortMap{}, "0")` has been replaced by `"115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639935"` in kore, due to the constraint `lookup(VarS:SortMap{}, "0") ==Int "115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639935"`. The booster does not recognise this as a substitution, because it isn't of the shape `VarFoo ==Int ...`
* Kore returns several constraints in the predicate field, derived from the ceil condition of the input, namely predicates `VarCALLEE_ID:SortInt{} =/=Int "1"`, `VarCALLEE_ID:SortInt{} =/=Int VarCONTRACT_ID:SortInt{}` and `VarCONTRACT_ID:SortInt{} =/=Int "1"` indicating the keys are distinct, together with `notBool AccountCellMap:in_keys(<acctID>("1"), VarACCOUNTS_CELL_c4b4abbc:SortAccountCellMap{})` conditions. I don't think these are strictly necessary to be returned.
