Builtin functions as described in [docs/hooks.md](https://github.com/runtimeverification/haskell-backend/blob/master/docs/hooks.md).
Only selected functions are implemented.

Built-in functions are looked up by their symbol attribute 'hook' from
the definition's symbol map.

The built-in function fails outright when its function is called with
a wrong argument count. When required arguments are unevaluated, the
hook returns 'Nothing'.
