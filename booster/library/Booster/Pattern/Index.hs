{- | Index data allowing for a quick lookup of potential axioms.

A @Term@ is indexed by inspecting the top term component of one or
more given cells. A @TermIndex@ is a list of @CellIndex@es.

The @CellIndex@ of a cell containing a @SymbolApplication@ node is the
symbol at the top. Other terms that are not symbol applications have
index @Anything@.

Rather than making the term indexing function partial, we introduce a
unique bottom element @None@ to the index type (to make it a lattice).
This can then handle @AndTerm@ by indexing both arguments and
combining them.

NB for technical reasons we derive 'Ord' instances but it does not
reflect the fact that different symbols (and likewise different
constructors) are incompatible (partial ordering).

{- | Combines two indexes (an "infimum" function on the index lattice).

  This is useful for terms containing an 'AndTerm': Any term that
  matches an 'AndTerm t1 t2' must match both 't1' and 't2', so 't1'
  and 't2' must have "compatible" indexes for this to be possible.

{- | Compute all indexes that cover the given index, for rule lookup.

  An index B is said to "cover" another index A if all parts of B are
  either equal to the respective parts of A, or 'Anything'.

  When selecting candidate rules for a term, we must consider all
  rules whose index has either the exact same @CellIndex@ or
  @Anything@ at every position of their @TermIndex@.
