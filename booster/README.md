# Haskell Backend Booster

A simpler and faster version of [K-Framework's haskell-backend](../haskell-backend).

* A simple rewrite engine that focuses on the K configuration as the main term
* Aims to solve _easy and common_ rewrites quickly, rather than _all_ rewrites completely
* Reverts to the standard backend for complex unification and term simplification
